this is an interactive, simple shell tester program that automates the tests that are available on the https://simple-shell-tests.vercel.app

the program only tests the mandatorty tasks.

how to run and use the program:

firt of all: clone the repo to where your simple shell program is

there is two option to choose from: download and test

1 - run the following command to download all the tests to your current directory where the ./hsh is.
        python3 simple_shell_tester.py download
   -> a directory with the name simple_shell_tests will appear in your current directory with all the tests and the checker inside

2 - run the following command to launch the tests:
        python3 simple_shell_tester.py test

an interactive prompt will appear:
    1 - type 1 if you want to run all the test at once
    2 - type 2 to run single test (check the website above)
    3 - type 3 to run all the tests of a specific task (again check the site for task numbers)
    4 - type 4 to exit the program

this my humble attempt to automate this testing process that is overwelming
please if you find any bugs or any problems let me know and good luck
